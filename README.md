# minishell

42 project by vsanin & zpiarova - work in progress
NUMBER OF TIMES WE CHANGED LEXER: IIIII - almost at end of project and still found a mistake here:D - whitespace(s) at end of input leaks
NUMBER OF TIMES WE CHANGED PARSER: I
- tester: https://github.com/LucasKuhn/minishell_tester

# TODO
- handle heredoc << - - heredoc does not work with commands, I think because they take input from stdin and not from another token
- set error codes properly - implement errno && must update exit status at end of each of these functions
- how to handle unclosed brackets or unclosed quotes and pipe at the end of input - HEREDOC ???
- multiple terminals?
- static mode ?
- signals error: when we run a command that waits for input eg. cat or sort, and press ^C, it will go bask to start of minishell IN THAT PROCESS so we get minishell > minishell >
- handle flags ?? if there are some, move it to shell implementation, if not use
- sc error message shows cd and then cd again nstead of the non-existing folder
- check if there is actual cmd->cmd in cmd (the name/path o cmd)

## test cases
echo -nnnnnnnnnnnnnn hello

# HEREDOC MAIN THINGS - VLAD
main things:
- started working on heredoc: major question is how and when it's called. i think our initial idea was to call it before lexer - probably impossible because it hasn't been tokenized yet and although it could work, it's hard when working with only a string of input. the catch is with the quotes (reasoning a couple bullets below): for the heredoc to process quotes around delimiter and to decide whether or not to expand the following $, it has to, well, have the quotes. since we trim the quotes and expand during lexer, we also need to start handling heredoc during lexer. we cannot take the result of lexer, traverse it and check for quotes simply because there are no quotes. we can't do the whole heredoc yet, the idea for now is to make the exception for the token that follows << that would ignore the quotes
- UPDATE: this idea currently works, any text token that's after << does not get expanded or get its quotes trimmed. now this can go into further processing
- WIP: main heredoc implementation

specifics and edge cases:
- "<< DELIMITER" should work even though it doesn't consider << a command (not a text type). in the token list it shows as << type 6, DELIMITER type 0, in the command the cmd name is null, and the DELIMITER is the redir file. DELIMITER being a redir file doesn't make sense, but we can use it to extract its value to compare against in the heredoc loop. it just has to do nothing since no command is specified, even if a command is inside the heredoc loop. so gotta handle this specific case
- "ls << EOF -la" will also apply the flags afterwards so << DELIMITER doesn't have to be the last thing it does
- << '$USER' and << "$USER" DON'T EXPAND from what i tried - BOTH as COMMANDS inside the heredoc loop AND DELIMITERS. examples at the bottom of readme
- for validator/evaluator, << cannot be followed by any redirs, pipes or nothing/newlines (tested in bash), seems to only work with a string delimiter which is nice
- there can, however, be several sequences of << delimiter << delimiter ... which is not nice
- heredoc not only reads regular input but can also read from scripts/files.. - non-interactive and we should use get next line for that, so two separate approaches

- heredoc generally works by overwriting the value of token after << with a colleceted string - GREAT (Zuzana)
- lexer get_token_list edits and fixes

- heredoc seems to work, signal handling realized, double free issues avoided
- just need to move some functions to other files
- tried to comment all functions so it's understandable later - <3 Zuzka

# general notes

1. assume:
char **head;
char **temp = head;

don't use (*temp)++ to move the pointer when accessing strings themselves, it changes the starting position of strings within head, causing corruption.

reason: temp is a separate pointer iterating over the array, so it doesn't modify head itself. However, the problem lies in the line:
(*temp)++;
This alters the actual char * string that temp points to, meaning you're modifying the original head's strings' pointers, not just moving through the array.

weird shit but it's fixed :D

2. do this when using strjoin to avoid leaks - free the old res value before reassigning (setting to NULL probably doesn't matter but anyway):
to_append = ft_substr(text, (*i) - len, len);
oldres = res;
res = ft_strjoin(res, to_append);
free(oldres);
free(to_append);
oldres = NULL;
to_append = NULL;

3. when freeing token list, changed the function to use a double pointer (t_token **token), so we pass in the address of original pointer. This allows you to modify the callerâ€™s reference directly, setting it to NULL after freeing all nodes (tsken from GPT) so now we set the head of token list to NULL to avoid double frees - I dont understand it well yet but kinda makes sense
