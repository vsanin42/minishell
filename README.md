# november 14 add-ins by Vlad
- braces after $ and unclosed quotes are handled right after receiving input and before passing to lexer - keeping it for now or until we find a safe way of doing it in a heredoc style

# november 18 add-ins by Vlad
main things:
- started working on heredoc: major question is how and when it's called. i think our initial idea was to call it before lexer - probably impossible because it hasn't been tokenized yet and although it could work, it's hard when working with only a string of input. the catch is with the quotes (reasoning a couple bullets below): for the heredoc to process quotes around delimiter and to decide whether or not to expand the following $, it has to, well, have the quotes. since we trim the quotes and expand during lexer, we also need to start handling heredoc during lexer. we cannot take the result of lexer, traverse it and check for quotes simply because there are no quotes. we can't do the whole heredoc yet, the idea for now is to make the exception for the token that follows << that would ignore the quotes
- UPDATE: this idea currently works, any text token that's after << does not get expanded or get its quotes trimmed. now this can go into further processing
- WIP: main heredoc implementation

specifics and edge cases:
- "<< DELIMITER" should work even though it doesn't consider << a command (not a text type). in the token list it shows as << type 6, DELIMITER type 0, in the command the cmd name is null, and the DELIMITER is the redir file. DELIMITER being a redir file doesn't make sense, but we can use it to extract its value to compare against in the heredoc loop. it just has to do nothing since no command is specified, even if a command is inside the heredoc loop. so gotta handle this specific case
- "ls << EOF -la" will also apply the flags afterwards so << DELIMITER doesn't have to be the last thing it does
- << '$USER' and << "$USER" DON'T EXPAND from what i tried - BOTH as COMMANDS inside the heredoc loop AND DELIMITERS. examples at the bottom of readme
- for validator/evaluator, << cannot be followed by any redirs, pipes or nothing/newlines (tested in bash), seems to only work with a string delimiter which is nice
- there can, however, be several sequences of << delimiter << delimiter ... which is not nice
- heredoc not only reads regular input but can also read from scripts/files.. - non-interactive and we should use get next line for that, so two separate approaches


# november 19 by Vlad
- heredoc generally works by overwriting the value of token after << with a colleceted string - GREAT (Zuzana)
- lexer get_token_list edits and fixes

# november 20 by Vlad
- heredoc seems to work, signal handling realized, double free issues avoided
- just need to move some functions to other files
- tried to comment all functions so it's understandable later

# november 21 - Vlad
- went over most of our paths for returning errors to verify it all makes sense
- regarding error handling: we don't really need a function that will return a prompt at the moment when an error condition is found - ideally it should create a cascade of returns with errors/nulls so that it reaches the initial caller functions which would finally break the process_input() function and give us another prompt
- changed the return values of lexer, parser, etc. to reflect normal state or ERROR, so far all assignments were happening without checking if the return values are ok
- fixed the main argc != 1 case where it would print extra prompt, error_msg() is not needed at that point yet
- removed check for unclosed quotes in lexer quote handling, it's done in check_input(), shouldn't matter anyway
- did a lot of cleaning, protecting memory, etc - potential pain points are new_cmd() and exp_sub() but so far so good

# TODO
- major free function + error handling at all times
- handle heredoc <<
- set error codes properly - implement errno
- how to handle unclosed brackets or unclosed quotes and pipe at the end of input - HEREDOC ???
- also when env is the first text arg and it will not expand we do not have command to run  - what bash does it then goes to the next text element and stores this as command and the rest aas arguments
- pass struct mini to all functions that may need to quit the program
- also now when we have unclosed quotes or braces or non-alnum char in braces we exit the program but we could just print the error message and continue with waiting for input
- make it accept not only readline input but also get next line for reading from something - that's the non-interactive part. no idea how to test. isatty() function is used
- must check for pipes at start/end before starting to process input
- HANDLE RELATIVE PATH IN THE GET_ENV_PATH = check first if we already maybe got a relative path, if not only then continue to searching the path in $PATH
- multiple terminals?
- check first for builtins,then relative path(starting with ./ or ../), then check absolute path (starting with /), then check $PATH
- cd builtin - check if path exists - relative, absolute, $PATH AND add error handling before
- group the functions in files better - eg. do files starting with type_... to store functions for out files e. type_cmd will store get_cmd_count, etc.
- heredoc: error handling, handle case with nothing after <<
- MAYBE?? for grep and possibly some other commands the trailing "" should stay as it then interprets it as a phrase
- cat -n leaks
- commands not found leak
- passing environment variable as first token big error eg. $BLA
- error when we have infile - invalid reads

# general notes

1. assume:
char **head;
char **temp = head;

don't use (*temp)++ to move the pointer when accessing strings themselves, it changes the starting position of strings within head, causing corruption.

reason: temp is a separate pointer iterating over the array, so it doesn't modify head itself. However, the problem lies in the line:
(*temp)++;
This alters the actual char * string that temp points to, meaning you're modifying the original head's strings' pointers, not just moving through the array.

weird shit but it's fixed :D

2. do this when using strjoin to avoid leaks - free the old res value before reassigning (setting to NULL probably doesn't matter but anyway):
to_append = ft_substr(text, (*i) - len, len);
oldres = res;
res = ft_strjoin(res, to_append);
free(oldres);
free(to_append);
oldres = NULL;
to_append = NULL;

3. when freeing token list, changed the function to use a double pointer (t_token **token), so we pass in the address of original pointer. This allows you to modify the callerâ€™s reference directly, setting it to NULL after freeing all nodes (tsken from GPT) so now we set the head of token list to NULL to avoid double frees - I dont understand it well yet but kinda makes sense
